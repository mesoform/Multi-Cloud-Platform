* use 2 character indents
* global variables and constants in all capitals
* global variables and constants declared at the beginning of the file wherever possible
* local variables in all lowercase
* variable and function naming to use snake_case
* functional programming for shell scripts
* hard-coded values should be avoided unless there is a good reason (I.e. for security)
* tests should be in a directory named `tests`
* install a suitable IDE formatting plugin and run it before pushing changes. I.e. On Jetbrains IDEs
 there is Shell Script Formatter which should have be ran (with CTRL+ALT+L or CMD+OPT+L) on each
 script
